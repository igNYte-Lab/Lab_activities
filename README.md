**Long-term_Wildfire_prediction**

This study models and projects future wildfire susceptibility, explicitly considering the interplay of climate and vegetation evolution. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) captures the non-linear spatial dependencies of wildfire susceptibility on landscape and climate variables.
